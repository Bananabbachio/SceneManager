# SceneManager
It was made in C++ with the SDL library, it has not been tested yet, only works in theory, I don't recommand you using it.

I used a template made by someone, I don't remember, the SDL template could probably be found somewhere on Github.

This scene manager is no necessary meant to be used in later projects but mainly an exercice.
